# OSL shaders
This is a collection of shaders written in OSL (Open shading language).

They are developped in Houdini on Arnold (using HtoA) but can work in a lot of different renderers/DCCs (arnold, vray, 3dsmax, blender...).

Available shaders :
  - TextSader : procedural text shader, no need for maps
